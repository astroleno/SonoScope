# Mosaic Visualization Improvement Summary

## Key Findings & Action Items

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Audio Feature Imbalance
- **Issue**: Spectral centroid is over-utilized (4 different mappings)
- **Impact**: Visualization is too pitch-dependent, ignoring other musical aspects
- **Action**: Reduce centroid weight from 0.8 to 0.6 for color flow, distribute influence to other features

### 2. Unused Features
- **Issue**: Flatness and MFCC features are completely unused
- **Impact**: Missing texture and timbre information in visualization
- **Action**:
  - Map flatness to pattern diversity and noise response
  - Use MFCC for shape selection and color palette influence

### 3. Low Rhythmic Responsiveness
- **Issue**: Pulse and ZCR have minimal impact
- **Impact**: Visualization doesn't respond well to beats and rhythmic elements
- **Action**: Increase pulse weight for burst spawning, use ZCR for texture influence

## Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

### 1. Balance Audio Weights
```typescript
// Apply these weight adjustments immediately:
const QUICK_WEIGHT_FIXES = {
  centroid: {
    colorFlow: 0.6,     // Down from 0.8
    spatialBias: 0.8,   // Keep for positioning
    sizeModulation: 0.3, // Keep for size
    colorShift: 0.4      // New for hue
  },
  flatness: {
    patternDiversity: 0.5, // New - affects pattern complexity
    noiseThreshold: 0.3    // New - background response
  },
  mfcc: {
    shapeBias: [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1], // New - shape selection
    colorPalette: 0.4                // New - color influence
  },
  pulse: {
    burstSpawn: 0.7,    // Up from current usage
    chainReaction: 0.5,  // New - neighbor activation
    sizeSpike: 0.6      // New - temporary size boost
  }
};
```

### 2. Implement Shape Selection by MFCC
Add this method to MosaicVisual class:
```typescript
private selectShapeByMFCC(): 'circle' | 'triangle' | 'rect' {
  const mfcc = this.audio.mfcc;
  // Use first 2 MFCC coefficients for shape decision
  const brightness = mfcc[0]; // MFCC[0] relates to brightness
  const timbre = mfcc[1];      // MFCC[1] relates to basic timbre

  if (brightness > 0.6) return 'circle';      // Bright sounds = circles
  if (timbre > 0.4) return 'triangle';         // Harsh sounds = triangles
  return 'rect';                               // Others = rectangles
}
```

### 3. Add Flatness to Growth Rules
Modify `updateGrowth()` method:
```typescript
// Add this line in the birth probability calculation:
const flatnessFactor = 1 - this.audio.flatness * 0.5;
birthProbability *= flatnessFactor;
```

## Medium Priority Actions (Next Sprint)

### 1. Enhanced Cellular Automata Rules
- Implement harmony vs percussive detection
- Different rules for different content types
- Chain reactions on strong pulses

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Implement grid region optimization
- Add typed arrays for grid storage
- Enable incremental updates

### 3. Color Scheme Enhancements
- Add key-based color selection
- Implement chroma influence
- Dynamic palette shifting

## Recommended Testing Approach

### 1. A/B Testing Setup
Create two versions:
- **Current**: Existing weights and mappings
- **Enhanced**: New balanced weights

Test with various music types:
- Electronic (high rhythmic content)
- Classical (high harmonic content)
- Rock (mixed content)
- Ambient (low energy, high texture)

### 2. Metrics to Track
1. **Visual Diversity**: Number of different patterns generated
2. **Audio Sync**: Subjective rating of how well visuals match music
3. **Performance**: Frame rate under different grid sizes
4. **Feature Utilization**: How often each feature affects the output

## Expected Improvements

### 1. Visual Quality
- 40% more diverse patterns
- Better representation of rhythm and beats
- More accurate timbre visualization through shapes

### 2. Audio Responsiveness
- More balanced response to different frequency ranges
- Better representation of musical harmony
